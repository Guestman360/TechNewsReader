An iOS app I built in Swift 3, it makes use of JSON parsing, tableviews, animations, has the ability to switch between multiple news websites to display in the tableview. Still a work in progress as I'm adding new features, but it is a solid app as its is right now.

Technologies used:
- JSON parsing
- Tableviews
- Stroyboard
- Animations
- Webview
